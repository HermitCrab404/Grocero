# Grocero
A web app that grabs grocery store products/ food prices and compares them to find the store which will save you the most money. It has now been extended to far more websites including amazon and ebay.

All of the backend code is functional, the front end is being worked on currently to make it completely functional

To use:
Go to the config.py file in the data collection folder and replace the default variables with your api details. If you do not have a kroger api key click the link to set up your own api key

Replace the sys.argv variables in the data collection file for term and zip code to search for the items you want.
